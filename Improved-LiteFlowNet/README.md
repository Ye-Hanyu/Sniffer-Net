## Improved-LiteFlowNet

The Improved-LiteFlowNet comes from the LiteFlowNet with our modification.

Although we have modified the network structure and parameters, the configuration method has not been changed, which can still refer to the method of tak-wai Hui et al.

For more details about original LiteFlowNet, please visit its project website. https://github.com/twhui/LiteFlowNet
